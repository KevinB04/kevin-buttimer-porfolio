# kevin-buttimer-porfolio

This project was a great opportunity for me to apply what I have learned about web development in order to create my own website. Here are a few things that I wished to accomplish:

- Use semantic elements so that my site would be easily accessible.
- Create a navbar
- Maintain a responsive layout and images

## Installation
