# kevin-buttimer-porfolio

This project was a great opportunity for me to apply what I have learned about web development in order to create my own website. Here are a few things that I wished to accomplish:

- Use semantic elements so that my site would be easily accessible.
- Create a navbar
- Maintain a responsive layout and images

## Installation

In order to run this app, you should fork the repo, clone it, and open in your default browser.

## Usage

You have the opportunity to view multiple pages on my page. You can navigate through my site using the "About", "Porfolio", and "Contact" tabs.

## Credits

A huge thank you to my instructor, TAs, fellow classmates, and my tutor for their guidance with this project.
